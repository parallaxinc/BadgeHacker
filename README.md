## Bulk Programmer

BadgeHacker includes a powerful parallel loader that allows
event coordinators to make short work of badge programming. Use a spreadsheet
program to create your complete event guest list, then use the Bulk Programmer
to easily load individual contacts onto each badge.

Connect and program many badges at once and be done in a fraction of the time!
